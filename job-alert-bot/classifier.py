Sends a company's candidate jobs to the LLM for classification against
the experience/location filters. Large batches are automatically split
into smaller chunks (MAX_JOBS_PER_BATCH each) so no single request gets
too big and slow. Uses llm_client's multi-provider fallback chain, so
one provider's daily quota running out doesn't stall the whole run.

Requirement 1 (Experience): the role must be for freshers / entry-level / candidates with 0-1 years of professional experience. Reject roles asking for 2+ years, or titled "Senior", "Staff", "Lead", "Principal", or similar.

Requirement 2 (Location): the role must be EITHER fully remote and open to candidates globally, OR based in India. Trust each job's "Official Listed Location" as the source of truth - use its description only to add detail, not to override it. Reject roles restricted to a specific country other than India, and reject on-site/hybrid roles located outside India.

A job only matches if BOTH requirements are satisfied.
