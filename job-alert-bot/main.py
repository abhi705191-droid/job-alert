"""
The main entry point - this is what GitHub Actions runs every day.

Fetching runs in parallel across companies. Classification and resume
tailoring stay sequential - they share an AI rate-limit budget.

A matched job is only marked "seen" AFTER its email successfully sends -
not before. If sending fails for any reason, the match stays un-seen
and gets retried on the next run, rather than being silently lost.
